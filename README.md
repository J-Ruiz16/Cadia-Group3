Brief: program includes definition and implementation of a deque using 2D dynamic arrays.


Implementation Description: Deque template class with pushing front and back, popping front back, checking for empty deck, size

What seems to work:
The program compiles and runs but there may be small mistakes within the pop or push logic that we could not determine. 

Challenges:

- had trouble figuring out the logic for the pop back and front, private members
- Same thing for the push front/back.

How we shared work:

- She got started with the template and the pop front/pop back logic, I went through and made sure that the push front/back and operator
  was implemented and also worked on the main driver. 

Run program: ./dequetool
